# Big Arrow

Simple GPS-only navigation app for iOS and watchOS

## Building

The development team is set to `XXXXXXXXXX`, so you might want to change that. Also the bundle identifier `com.marcofiletti.ios.Big-Arrow` and group identifier `group.com.marcofiletti.ios.Big-Arrow` are associated to the app store app and should be changed to something else for the app to work properly on physical devices. Apart from that, the app should build and run without any modifications on Xcode 12.4.
